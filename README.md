# Secure Password Generator
This project's goal is to use Python language to create a random password generator, and provide a "safety" indicator by calculating its entropy.
The project is clearly for practice and fun and its outcome should not be used by any means as password for any account.

## Usage
You can run the program from terminal by running the following command in the directory of the python files:
`python main.py`
You can also use arguments to set the password length and to choose if the password will have digits, uppercase letters and special characters.
- -l <N>, --length <N>: Create a password of N characters
- -d, --digits: Select this argument to use digits
- -u, --uppercase: Select this argument to use uppercase letters
- -s, --special-chars: Select this argument to use special characters
- -v, --version: Print the version of the program
